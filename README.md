# The Untangled Web Framework

The Untangled web framework is a ClojureScript web framework that blends various web development libraries together
with a good bit of glue code to make single-page webapps a breeze. It is a full-stack environment, but you can
pick and choose the pieces you wish to use. You can use any database, and you can even use whatever server you
want (though you'll benefit greatly from using our server component).

The full stack framework includes a number of libraries (See [untangled-web](https://github.com/untangled-web) on Github):
